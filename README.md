This is a PHP library for communicating with the XRP Ledger.

In addition to wrapping the `rippled` API, it validates method/transaction parameters and normalizes responses.

Refer to the [API Documentation](https://developers.ripple.com/rippled-api.html)
in the [Ripple Developer Portal](https://developers.ripple.com/) for methods, parameters, and expected responses.

## Dependencies

This project implements [PSR-7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) via the use of
[HTTPLUG](http://docs.php-http.org/en/latest/index.html) so the developer can select the
[HTTP Client](http://docs.php-http.org/en/latest/clients.html) best suited for their
architecture.

If you do not have a preference, simply run the command below and proceed to the
installation section.

```
composer require php-http/guzzle6-adapter php-http/message
```
```
composer require hwi/oauth-bundle php-http/httplug-bundle

```
## Installation

```
composer require foxrp/rippled-php
```

## QuickStart

### Retrieve Balance

```php
<?php

use FOXRP\Rippled\Client;

$client = new Client('https://s1.ripple.com:51234');

$balance = null;

$response = $client->send('account_info', [
    'account' => 'rG1QQv2nh2gr7RCZ1P8YYcBUKCCN633jCn'
]);

// Set balance if successful.
if ($response->isSuccess()) {
    $data = $response->getResult();
    $balance = $data['account_data']['Balance'];
}
```

See [Exception Handling](docs/Exceptions.md) for more control over handling errors.

## Unit Testing

Run the unit test suite:

```
make test
```

Run test coverage:

```
make cov
```

Once you run the coverage command, open `tests/coverage/index.html` to view the report.

## Functional Testing

Functional tests run code against a live server. Of course this should be run against a test server.

If you don't already have test accounts, create 2 and note the account id and secret for each.

https://developers.ripple.com/xrp-test-net-faucet.html

The functional test suite loads endpoint and account info from `.env.test`.

If you haven't already, copy `.env.test.dist` to `.env.test` and add your account info.

`FOXRP_ACCT_1_ID` requires `100` XRP for the tests.

Use the following command to run the functional test suite.

```
make testf
```
